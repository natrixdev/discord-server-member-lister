# Discord Server Members List
A Python program that lists all the users of a Discord server with a good-looking interface

This program uses the discord and tkinter libraries to list all the users of a Discord server in a graphical interface. To use this program, you will need to insert your Discord server's ID in the line server = client.get_guild(INSERT_GUILD_ID_HERE).

This program uses an asynchronous function to list the users of the Discord server, and a Tkinter GUI to display the list of users in a good-looking interface. When the "Show Users" button is clicked, the list of users is displayed in the GUI.
